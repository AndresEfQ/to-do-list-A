// add the event listener module

// import "src/eventListenerModule.js";

import "./eventListenerModule";

import "./domLogic";

import "./conditionalLogic";

import "./arrayStorage";

// import "./style.scss";

// check array and local storage,

// local storage and array seems to be working fine, it is adding onto the current selections,

// I think next would be to add an event listener to the project names, to begin adding to-do's to projects

// ok so looking at the project for inspiration, 

// project names are added to the projects section 

// saved to an array and storage, 

// then if the project names are clicked, they are displayed in the main content section, 

// then once added to the main content section, user should be able to click a add btn or a trash btn, 

// add btn will make a form for todos to be added, then once added those todos will be displayed, 

// delete btn will permanately delete the todo/task. 

// how to prevent dynamically created element JS elements from forming when function is called? 

// fix up current code to use modules, move to own function 

// seperating the code is not working, can't add an event listener there, 

// I want to use the same logic I had before but to split the logic up into different modules, 

// take the div element 

// when you click on a project name, that project name should appear in the main section (fine) 

// It should also add the add todo btn along with cancel btn
